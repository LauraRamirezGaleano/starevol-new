   1. (optional)
      Generate a network from all documented rates in the required format

   8. (optional)
      Generate a network between Zmin, Zmax with fixed boundaries with
      respect to drip or stability lines   

   2. Check baryon and proton balance for the network,
      Check network syntax,
      Compute Q, Qneutrino values for the network using Audi's mass table
   3. Generate the table of reaction rates for the considered network 
   4. Compute the matrix shape parameters for routine EIGEN, and write the
         network in coded form

   5. Plot some selected reactions

   9. ****HELP****

  10. Generate a list of all available reaction rates (except SMOKER),
         with references for the rates
  11. Plot the atlas of all documented reaction rates
  12. Generate table of all documented reaction rates

 Do you have a file with your own temperature grid? 

   [Such a file should have the format:

Do you want the data in lines or columns? (l/c)l
++++
 Do you have a file with your choices of biblio reference indices
           for **some** (not necessarily all) reactions? 

   [Such a file should have the format: 

       nreac bibindex
       nreac bibindex
       ...
    where nreac is the reaction number in the network file
    and bibindex the corresponding biblio reference index]
